# University Projects

This repository contains a collection of **projects and assignments** completed during my undergraduate studies in **Mechatronics Engineering**.  
The work spans multiple courses and covers topics in **control systems, signal processing, embedded systems, digital image processing, and circuit design**.

### Repository Structure
Each folder represents a specific course or project and includes:
- 📂 **Source files / simulation files** (MATLAB, Proteus, Keil, etc.)  
- 📝 **Reports** with detailed analysis and results  
- 📄 **README.md files** providing a brief description of the contents  

### Highlights
- **Linear Control Systems (LCS):** Suspension system modeling and transfer function analysis.  
- **Digital Image Processing (DIP):** Crack detection in concrete using image segmentation.  
- **Electronic Circuit Design:** Sallen-Key active filter simulation in Proteus.  
- **Signals and Systems:** Assignments and projects on low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters.  

### Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A **record of academic projects** developed throughout my degree.  
- A **reference** for anyone interested in practical implementations of engineering concepts.  
- A **portfolio** showcasing my experience in simulation, analysis, and problem-solving.
