# Sallen-Key Signal Filter â€“ Proteus Simulation

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **Sallen-Key Active Filter** using **Proteus**.  
The filter was implemented to analyze its effect on an input waveform, focusing on how it attenuates unwanted frequency components and amplifies the desired signal.

### Project Overview
- Designed and simulated a **Sallen-Key low-pass filter** in Proteus.  
- Examined the filterâ€™s performance with a function generator input.  
- Compared the **original waveform**, the **filtered output**, and the **amplified signal**.  
- Verified the circuitâ€™s frequency response and time-domain behavior.
