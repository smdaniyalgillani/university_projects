# Vehicle Suspension System â€“ Assignments & Project

This folder contains coursework developed for the **Linear Control Systems (LCS)** semester project.  
It includes both an **assignment** and a **project** focused on modeling and analyzing vehicle suspension systems.

- **Assignment:** Basic analysis of suspension system dynamics and preliminary transfer function formulation.  
- **Project:**  
  - Developed and proposed a transfer function model of a vehicle suspension system.  
  - Performed **MATLAB simulations** to analyze the systemâ€™s response under various road disturbances (e.g., potholes).  
  - Investigated system stability, ride comfort, and transient behavior.  

ðŸ“‚ Detailed results, plots, and explanations are included in the project reports provided in this folder.
