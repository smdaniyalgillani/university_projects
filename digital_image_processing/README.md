# Crack Detection in Concrete â€“ Digital Image Processing Project

This project focuses on **detecting cracks in concrete surfaces** using Digital Image Processing techniques.  
The objective was to automatically identify surface-level cracks from input images and generate processed outputs highlighting the damaged regions.

### Project Overview
- Preprocessing of input images for noise reduction and contrast enhancement.  
- Application of image segmentation and masking techniques to detect cracks.  
- Post-processing to highlight detected cracks for clearer visualization.  
- Evaluation of results on real-world concrete surface images.
