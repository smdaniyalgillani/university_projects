# Signals and Systems â€“ Assignments & Projects

This folder contains coursework for the **Signals and Systems** course, focusing on the analysis and processing of signals using different filtering techniques.

### Contents
- **Assignments:** Exercises on fundamental concepts such as time/frequency-domain analysis, convolution, and Fourier/Laplace transforms.  
- **Projects:** Implementation and analysis of filters including:  
  - **Low-Pass Filters** â€“ Attenuating high-frequency noise.  
  - **High-Pass Filters** â€“ Preserving high-frequency components while filtering out low-frequency signals.  
  - **Band-Pass Filters** â€“ Isolating signals within a specific frequency range.  
  - **Other Filter Designs** â€“ Applied to study signal behavior under different system responses.

### Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of how signals behave under various linear systems.  
- Application of MATLAB/Simulink (where applicable) to simulate and analyze signals.  
- Visualization of filtering effects on real and synthetic signals.
